# GW2-Legendary
A simple application to track the resources and hierarchy needed to build a legendary weapon in Guild Wars 2.

## Premise
There needs to be a good way to track your actual progress towards the creation of a legendary weapon, by tracking the aquisition of the component materials and displaying them in a hierarchical fashion so that it's visually easy to see what things you are missing.

## Features
* Hierarchical view to easily show which ingredients go together to make the legendary
* Tracks the numbers of ingredients so you know what you've got left to gather
* Tracks totals where multiple stacks of ingredients are needed for different components
* A nice big percentage progress bar
* Ability to select the legendary and see the ingredient tree
* Perhaps import the costs for ingredients
* Hash of progress to the url, so progress can be linked, or bookmarked. 
 * Perhaps backed by db with login.
